## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I haven't programmed in Python for a while, at least not as intensely as I did my freshman year in AP CSP. However, I still got most of the basics down and the exercises went relatively smooth. I'd still like to review more about data structs, especially dicts and sets since I barely worked with them. Overall, I didn't learn much of anything new, but this module was a nice refresher of my python skills.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
I liked the little tidbits of info. on deep learning scattered throughout the assignment! I'm interest to see the capailities of those neural nets and how they'll trasnform language. I was challenged most by the exercise on transforming a dictionary so that its values were in ascending order(exercise 3). I thought we had to iterate t/ the dit at first using the dict.items() and key,value format to access th values, but I gave up on that route and copy pasted from stackabuse instead, which used the sorted() function. Still not too happy about that. I also was surprised by the mention of opening and giving permission to read/write in a file since I'm notas familiar with the file system.
