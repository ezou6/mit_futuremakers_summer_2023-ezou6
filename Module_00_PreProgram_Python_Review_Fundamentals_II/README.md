# Python Fundamentals II

## Topics covered in today's module

* Object Oriented Programming
* Debugging in Python
* Package Handling

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
I really need to refresh my knowledge of how to define classes and read more documentation on debugging. I learned all about OOP in my App Dev class but forgot some of its tenets. The exercises were a simple, but effective refresher. I still wish the module offered more examples on constructing and initializing classes and more questions on fixing/debugging broken code.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
I didn't know there were so many ways to catch errors such as the except [insert error] method, raise [insert error] method, and assertions. I often debug just by using the simple print() method so learning other methods was helpful. I also never knew that finally blocks existed, though to be fair, I rarely use the try-exceptions blocks. I struggled SO MUCH with initializing a subclass from a superclass even though the actual code itself was simple. I scoured through the entire internetfor more than an hour just to find out I needed to use super() in the right areas.
