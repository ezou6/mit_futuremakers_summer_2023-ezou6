# NumPy

## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to NumPy
* Arrays/Matrices
* Matrix operations

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
The Numpy library is huge and there's still so much to read in its documentation. I'm still unfamiliar with most methods and have trouble multiplying matrices togetther, specificially 3d matrices. I'd like to experiment more on transposing, splicing and splitting matrices and to also familiarize myself on carrying out mathematical operations with axes. 

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
I am sometimes so confused on which methods a particular question wants me to implement since the documentation is quite large. I had to rely on ChatGPT for a majority of the questions since it was inefficient to search through the documentation manually. I had the most trouble with question 3 since I was convinced that it required me to use np.reshape(2,3,3) or manipulate the axes only to find out that using a.transpose(0,1,2) provided me with the answer with just a single line of code. I'm still not as confident with the answers ChatGPT gave me since they are so specific and rely on creating these new objects with unheard of methods, but they logically make sense to me.
